# bot137
Introducing a demo version of a Chatbot137 for registering urban problems - a solution aimed at improving the current process of issue reporting through a simple chatbot. This demo chatbot is designed to demonstrate how technology can be leveraged to provide citizens with an easy and convenient way to report urban problems such as potholes, damaged sidewalks, broken street lights, and more directly to the concerned authorities.
However, it should be noted that this chatbot is trained on limited data generated by the creators and their friends. The data is unofficial and the purpose of this demo is to show the potential for improvement in the current 137 call center of the municipality of Tehran.
The chatbot uses natural language processing to understand and categorize the reported issues based on the information provided by the user, streamlining the process of reporting and resolving urban problems.
